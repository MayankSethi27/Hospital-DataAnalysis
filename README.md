# 🏥 Hospital Data Analysis

This project analyzes hospital data to uncover trends and patterns related to patient admissions, hospital types, illness severity, and financial details. The analysis is performed using Python, `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.

## 📊 **Key Insights and Visualizations**
### 1. **Count of Type of Admission**
- Provides insight into the most common reasons for patient admissions (e.g., Emergency, Trauma, and Urgent).

### 2. **Average Admission_Deposit by Hospital Type with Severity of Illness**
- Shows how the average admission deposit varies based on the hospital type and the severity of the patient’s condition.

### 3. **Count of Type of Admission with Severity of Illness**
- Reveals the relationship between the type of admission and the severity of the illness, helping to understand hospital resource allocation.

### 4. **Distribution of Type of Admission**
- Displays the overall proportion of different admission types to identify patterns and trends.

### 5. **Correlations Between Different Factors**
- A heatmap showing how different numerical factors (e.g., deposit amount, visitor count) are correlated, helping identify key influencing factors.

### 6. **Trend of Deposit Amounts Over Time Based on Illness Severity**
- A line plot that highlights how deposit amounts change over time depending on the severity of the illness.
